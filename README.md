# herb_buddy
the chatbot for herbal plants with its own dataset and trained model

This repository contains code for an AI-driven chatbot that recommends Ayurvedic herbal plants based on user queries. Using BERT for natural language understanding, the system processes inputs and suggests relevant herbs or remedies. It includes training on a custom dataset, real-time prediction, and saving/loading models for efficient deployment.

Run the herbal_chatbot.py file because the model is already trained but if error shows regarding model training then run the chatbot.py file either in vs code (if GPU is avaliable with cuda cores) otherwise use google colab ( runtime allocation to T4 GPU or AX1000 gpu) it will take few minutes but will work.
